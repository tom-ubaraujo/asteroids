# Asteroids
Asteroid game from Boot.dev Python OOP course.

In this project we created a simple version of the classic Asteroid game, at the end of the Python OOP course. It made possible to practive concepts of OOP like classes, methods, inheritance, etc.

- Use W, A, S, D, to move the ship.
- Use SPACE to shoot at the asteroids.
- It's Game Over if the ship collides with an asteroid.
